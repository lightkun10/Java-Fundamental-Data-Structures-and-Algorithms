20.2.2 
Describe the Java Collections Framework. List the interfaces, 
convenience abstract classes, and concrete classes under the Collection interface.
Answer: Java Collections Framework is a set of classes 
        and interfaces with ready-made architecture.
        "Set", "List" and "Map" Interfaces are under the Collection interface
        A convenience class is an abstract class that 
        partially implements an interface. 
        The Java Collections Framework defines interfaces, 
        convenience abstract classes, and concrete classes.

20.2.3
Can a collection object be cloned and serialized?
Answer: Yes. All the concrete classes in Java Collections 
        Framework(Set, List, and Map) implement the java.lang.Cloneable and 
        java.io.Serializable interfaces with clone() method.

20.2.4
What method do you use to add all the elements from one collection 
to another collection?
Answer: addAll(Collection c);

20.2.5 
When should a method throw an UnsupportedOperationException?
Answer: If a method has no meaning in the subclass, you can 
        implement it in the subclass to 
        throw java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException, a subclass 
        of RuntimeException. This is a good design that you can 
        use in your project. If a method has no meaning in 
        the subclass, you can implement it as follows:
        ================================================
            public void someMethod() {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException
                ("Method not supported");
            }
        ================================================
